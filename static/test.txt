Unit one was an introduction
to the wonderful generating function.
We used them to count
a generalized amount
and we added relations in conjunction.

Unit two made relations equivalent
and switching functions had me ambivalent.
Then Burnside's Lemma
was quite the dilemma,
but its applications to generating functions were magnificent.

Unit three began with some matching,
and we learned about LaTeX formatting.
Then Philip Hall
had Nicky enthralled,
but the generating functions were lacking.
