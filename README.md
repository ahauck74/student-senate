#Commit 1:
- Flask talks nicely with the html forms
- Can turn html requst data into Python code

TODO:
- Store these form requests in our database
- Add validation for the form checks (are all required forms filled, is the email an email, etc...)
- Add the rest of the form requets once the form is corrected
